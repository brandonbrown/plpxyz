> A blog where I discuss DesignOps, Design Systems, and Design Workflows from the primary perspective of a Web Engineer

Hi, I'm Brandon, a web engineer currently heading a team of engineers in support of DesignOps at a Fortune 500 company. We build, maintain, and influence our Design System as well as offer solutions for designers and developers to better collaborate through the life-cycle of UX work and support the needs of our technology partners through the use of front-end tools and technologies.

The time I've spent with this team has caused many previously held opinions to shift, has brought new challenges into my scope of work, and has given me the greatest respect for systems-oriented solutions at scale. This website will be where I share many of these learnings and seek feedback from the community.

What to expect:
- Thoughtful articles on how DesignOps and Design Systems fit into organizations
- Practical technology examples on what it takes to ship code from within a DesignOps org
- Helpful tips on the people-side of this work
- The occasional hot-take on any of the above

### This site is being [built with Astro](https://astro.build/), in public

[Astro](https://astro.build/) sounds like a wonderful solution for content focused sites - maybe even some applications. With my wanting to share content, a framework that gets me to "Written and shipped" fast is the most helpful piece for me. In the past, I would have reached for Gatsby, Next, Jekyll in ye olden days- all of which come with their own pros + cons lists. Astro, at least from my needs and perspective, seems to have combined enough of the pros and dropped enough of the cons that I am very excited about jumping into it.

The things that have my attention:

- Directory based routing: Let's not confuse new comers with abstractions away from basic "we have directories, and they have files inside of them, sometimes other directories!" Simple, straight-forward, here are your routes.
- Easy to understand server/client rendering: Just slap "client: load" on a component and go.
- Mix & match frameworks: HTML, markdown, frameworks, jsx, TS, .astro- all out of the box.
- Scoped & Global CSS: This is the area I'm most curious of once I get to building. What is the CSS experience and what type of practices/habits will this reinforce. What I do like out of the gate is the sense of WebComponent thinking behind the management of scoped styles.
- APIs out of the pages directory?!

I'll likely drop some thoughts over on Xwitter while I'm at it. [Follow me over on x.com](https://x.com/bybrandonbrown) if you're interested in that sort of thing.
